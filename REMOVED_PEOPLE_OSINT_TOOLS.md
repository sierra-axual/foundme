# Removed People-Focused OSINT Tools - Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview
This document lists the people-focused OSINT tools that were removed from the FoundMe platform during implementation due to technical constraints. These tools can be re-implemented in future iterations once the installation issues are resolved.

## üö´ Removed Tools

### 1. PhoneInfoga
- **Purpose**: Advanced phone number reconnaissance
- **Removal Reason**: Go build complications and missing pre-built binaries
- **Error Encountered**: 
  ```
  package cmd/phoneinfoga/main.go is not in std
  go build -o phoneinfoga cmd/phoneinfoga/main.go failed
  ```
- **Alternative**: Could use pre-built binaries from releases or fix Go module structure
- **Priority**: Medium - Phone investigation is valuable for people tracking

### 2. Social Analyzer
- **Purpose**: Social media analysis and profiling
- **Removal Reason**: Complex Node.js dependencies and installation issues
- **Error Encountered**: npm install failures and dependency conflicts
- **Alternative**: Could containerize with specific Node.js version or use Docker multi-stage build
- **Priority**: High - Social media analysis is core to people tracking

### 3. SpiderFoot
- **Purpose**: Automated OSINT collection
- **Removal Reason**: pip installation failures
- **Error Encountered**: 
  ```
  ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement spiderfoot
  ERROR: No matching distribution found for spiderfoot
  ```
- **Alternative**: Could use Docker image or clone from GitHub repository
- **Priority**: Medium - Automation would enhance platform capabilities

### 4. Buster
- **Purpose**: Email to username enumeration
- **Removal Reason**: pip installation issues
- **Error Encountered**: Similar to SpiderFoot - package not found
- **Alternative**: Could investigate alternative email-to-username tools
- **Priority**: Low - Functionality partially covered by other tools

### 5. GHunt
- **Purpose**: Google account investigation
- **Removal Reason**: Simplified during implementation process
- **Alternative**: Could be re-added as a standalone tool
- **Priority**: Medium - Google account reconnaissance is valuable

### 6. WhatsMyName
- **Purpose**: Username enumeration framework
- **Removal Reason**: Simplified during implementation process
- **Alternative**: Could be re-added for enhanced username search
- **Priority**: Low - Functionality covered by Sherlock

## üîß Troubleshooting Steps for Re-implementation

### For Go-based Tools (PhoneInfoga):
1. Check for pre-built binaries in GitHub releases
2. Verify Go module structure and dependencies
3. Consider using specific Go version compatibility
4. Test in isolated environment before container integration

### For Node.js Tools (Social Analyzer):
1. Use specific Node.js version (e.g., Node 18 LTS)
2. Implement Docker multi-stage build
3. Resolve dependency conflicts with package-lock.json
4. Consider using yarn instead of npm

### For Python Tools (SpiderFoot, Buster):
1. Check for alternative package names
2. Use GitHub repository cloning instead of pip
3. Verify Python version compatibility
4. Check for Docker images or alternative installation methods

## üìã Re-implementation Checklist

- [ ] Test tool installation in isolated environment
- [ ] Verify all dependencies and requirements
- [ ] Create working wrapper scripts
- [ ] Update API endpoints and rate limits
- [ ] Test functionality with sample data
- [ ] Update documentation and user guides
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Add to monitoring and health checks

## üéØ Priority Order for Re-implementation

1. **Social Analyzer** - High priority (core social media analysis)
2. **PhoneInfoga** - Medium priority (phone investigation)
3. **SpiderFoot** - Medium priority (automation)
4. **GHunt** - Medium priority (Google reconnaissance)
5. **Buster** - Low priority (email-to-username)
6. **WhatsMyName** - Low priority (username enumeration)

## üìù Notes

- All removed tools were intended for people-focused OSINT
- Current platform maintains core functionality with 5 working tools
- Platform is stable and operational despite removed tools
- Future iterations can gradually re-implement these tools
- Consider implementing tools one at a time to maintain stability
