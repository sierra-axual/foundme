# üîé Data Discovery & Footprint Mapping

## Social Media Presence Mapping

Detect all accounts linked to a name, email, phone, or alias (public + semi-public sources).

Highlight verified vs. suspicious/impersonation accounts.

## Breach & Dark Web Exposure Check

Integrate with HaveIBeenPwned API (or custom dark web scrapers) to show exposed credentials.

Optionally automate breach artifact retrieval (if ethical + legal).

## Metadata Extraction

From images, PDFs, and documents posted online (EXIF, GPS, authorship info).

Show hidden risk: e.g., posting resumes with too much personal info.

## Geolocation Footprint

Track geotagged posts, leaked coordinates, or travel patterns.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk & Threat Analysis

### Identity Risk Score

Weighted score showing how exposed/vulnerable they are (similar to a credit score for digital footprint).

### Phishing/Impersonation Risk Alerts

Flag lookalike domains, fake profiles, or spoofed accounts.

### OSINT Threat Actor Angle

Show what an attacker could realistically exploit (e.g., weak password reuse, employer info, personal interests).

## üìä Visualization & Reporting

### Footprint Heatmap

Visual graph of their presence: social media nodes, domains, leaked accounts, forums, etc.

### Timeline View

Historical footprint‚Äîhow their exposure has grown or changed over time.

### Exportable Reports

Branded PDF/HTML reports for executives or board presentations.

Option for a "sanitized" version vs. "detailed" version.

## üîî Automation & Monitoring

### Continuous Monitoring

Watchlist for new mentions, leaks, or fake profiles.

Daily/weekly alerts via email/SMS.

### Brand & Reputation Tracking

Sentiment analysis of mentions.

Detect connections between their name and negative content (forums, blogs, news).

### Client Dashboard

Secure portal where they log in and see live updates rather than static reports.

## ‚úÖ Advisory & Actionable Steps

### Remediation Playbooks

For each finding, suggest next steps: e.g., "Change this password immediately," "Report this fake profile," "Request takedown."

### Privacy Optimization Checklist

Personalized privacy settings guide (per platform).

Show them what to turn off and how much it reduces their risk score.

### Attack Surface Simulation

Show a red-team style "What an attacker sees" perspective.

Could include spear-phish mockup, social engineering scenarios, or exposed documents.

## üöÄ Bonus "Cool Factor" Features

### AI-Powered Threat Narrative
Generate a "threat profile" story showing how a criminal could target them.

### Family & Inner Circle Monitoring
Option to extend monitoring to spouse/kids (high-value for execs).

### Data Broker Exposure
Show what data brokers (Spokeo, Pipl, Whitepages, etc.) hold on them, with opt-out links.

### Cross-Correlation
Find overlaps between personal and business footprint (e.g., same email used on a personal forum and LinkedIn).

## üëâ The Big Differentiator

The big differentiator will be combining OSINT data collection + risk interpretation + actionable remediation. Most tools stop at "here's your data." If you can show impact + fix path, you'll stand out.
